  - The endpoint is public for demo; restrict as needed for production.

## Plug-and-Play Demo Content Automation

This theme automatically sets up all demo content (pages, menus, widgets, homepage, blog page) on activation. All demo content is now generic and can be easily customized for any niche.

- Runs once on theme activation (uses an option flag to prevent duplicates)
- Creates Home, About, Contact, and Blog pages with example content (edit in functions.php for your use case)
- Creates and assigns Primary and Footer menus, with menu items
- Sets homepage and blog page
- Sets up sidebar widgets (Recent Posts, Categories, Search)
- All code is in functions.php, fully documented for customization

**To customize for your niche:**

- Edit the `$pages` and `$menus` arrays in `functions.php` (see comments)

**To re-run the automation:**

- Delete the `ab_mcp_demo_content_installed` option from the WordPress options table (e.g., via WP-CLI or phpMyAdmin)

**Best Practices:**

- The automation is idempotent and will not create duplicate content on re-activation
- All content is created using WordPress core APIs for maximum compatibility

## Troubleshooting Plug-and-Play Automation

- **Automation did not run:** Ensure the theme was activated from the Appearance > Themes screen. The automation only runs on activation.
- **Duplicate content:** The automation is designed to run only once. If you see duplicates, manually remove extra pages/menus and ensure the ab_mcp_demo_content_installed option is set.
- **Resetting automation:** Delete the ab_mcp_demo_content_installed option from the options table (use WP-CLI: `wp option delete ab_mcp_demo_content_installed` or phpMyAdmin).

## Integrations: Workflow Automation & Asset Utilization

- All major workflow automation tools (ApiX-Drive, Activepieces, Albato, PROCESIO, KonnectzIT, Stackby, BackupSheep, Flowlu, Agiled, SuiteDash, Brilliant Directory, Gemini, DeepSeek, Logically/Afforai, exa.ai) are now supported.
- Enter API keys and webhooks in the centralized Integrations settings page (Appearance > API Integrations).
- Hooks and filters are available for triggering automations on post/page/CPT events (see /inc/integrations/ for examples).
- Usage examples for each integration are provided in the documentation and code comments.
- Asset utilization (email, CRM, e-commerce, AI, analytics) is automated where possible; see integration files for details.
- To add new integrations, copy the pattern in /inc/integrations/ and register your API key in the settings page.

## Directorist & Add-on Integration

- All Directorist plugins (core, Listings With Map, Stripe, Pricing Plans) are modularly integrated via `inc/integrations/`.
- Custom fields, directory types, and add-on features are filterable and extensible.
- Dedicated CSS in `css/directorist-integration.css` ensures visual consistency.
- Integration tests for each add-on are in `tests/integrations/`.
- All logic is extensible and follows project best practices for maintainability.

## Modular Onboarding & Industry Starter Kits

- Use the onboarding page (Appearance > Get Started / Import Starter Kit) to select and import an industry-specific starter kit (niche pack).
- Each starter kit provides demo content, directory types, custom fields, and sample listings for a specific industry (e.g., Real Estate, Legal Services).
- All starter kits are modular, opt-in, and do not affect the core theme. Imported content is tagged for easy reset.
- To add a new starter kit, create a PHP file in `/inc/niche-packs/` following the provided examples.
- The core theme remains fully niche-agnostic and untouched.
