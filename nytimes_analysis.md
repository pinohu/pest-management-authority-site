# Analysis of The New York Times Website Architecture

## Overview

The New York Times website (nytimes.com) represents a best practice example of a large news/media authority website with sophisticated information architecture, comprehensive topic coverage, and a content-first approach.

## Primary Navigation Structure

### Multi-Tiered Navigation System

The New York Times employs a sophisticated multi-tiered navigation system:

1. **Global Navigation Bar** - Top-level sections and utility functions

   - Main news sections (U.S., World, Business, Arts, etc.)
   - Utility links (Subscribe, Log in, Today's Paper)
   - Edition switcher (U.S., International, Canada, etc.)

2. **Section Navigation** - Expandable submenus for each main section

   - Each main section has a dropdown with subsections
   - Provides access to specialized content areas

3. **Specialized Content Hubs** - Standalone branded sections
   - Games, Cooking, Wirecutter, The Athletic
   - Each with distinct navigation and content organization

This layered approach allows The New York Times to organize an enormous amount of content while maintaining clear pathways for users.

  - Example: nytimes.com/section/world/europe

Article URLs include date and keyword-rich slugs:

- nytimes.com/[year]/[month]/[day]/[section]/[article-slug]
