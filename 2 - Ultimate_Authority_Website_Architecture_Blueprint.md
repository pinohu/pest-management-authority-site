   - Comprehensive guides on primary topic areas (10-15 main pillars)
   - Hub pages that serve as content indexes for each major topic
   - Visual navigation showing relationships between topics

2. **Topic Clusters (Level 2)**

   - Subtopic pages covering specific aspects of each pillar (8-12 per pillar)
   - Supporting content addressing specific questions or applications
   - Internal linking structure establishing topical relationships

3. **Supporting Content (Level 3)**

   - Specialized pages on niche aspects, variations, or specific applications
   - FAQ content addressing common questions
   - Case studies and examples demonstrating practical applications

4. **Supplementary Resources (Level 4)**
   - Tools, calculators, and interactive elements
   - Templates and downloadable resources
   - Glossary entries and reference materials

#### Content Distribution Guidelines

| Content Level           | Quantity | Depth         | Update Frequency  | Word Count Range |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Pillar Content          | 10-15    | Comprehensive | Every 6-12 months | 2,500-5,000+     |
| Topic Clusters          | 80-180   | Detailed      | Every 6-12 months | 1,500-3,000      |
| Supporting Content      | 200-500+ | Focused       | As needed         | 800-1,500        |

### 3. URL Structure and Hierarchy

A logical, hierarchical URL structure that reflects content relationships and supports SEO:

#### URL Pattern Guidelines

| Content Type  | URL Pattern                                | Example                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Home Page     | domain.com                                 | example.com                                   |
| Main Category | domain.com/category/                       | example.com/guides/                           |
