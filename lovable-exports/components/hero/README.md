# Hero Component Export

## JavaScript Interactions

No JavaScript interactions are required for the static Hero component as exported. All layout and interactivity (such as the CTA button) are handled via HTML and CSS only.

If you wish to add dynamic behavior (e.g., smooth scroll, modal open on CTA click), you can add JavaScript as needed for your use case.

## WordPress Conversion Notes

- Use the HTML as a block in the WordPress editor (Gutenberg Custom HTML block).
- Add the CSS to your theme's stylesheet or via the Customizer > Additional CSS.
- Replace static text/images with dynamic WordPress fields as needed.
- For background or centered variants, adjust classes and structure as shown in the React component.
- Ensure all class names are unique to avoid style conflicts.
