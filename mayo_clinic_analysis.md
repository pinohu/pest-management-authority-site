# Analysis of Mayo Clinic Website Architecture

## Overview

Mayo Clinic's website (mayoclinic.org) represents a best practice example of a large healthcare authority website with patient-centered navigation, comprehensive health information, and a clear organizational structure.

## Primary Navigation Structure

### Audience-Based Navigation System

Mayo Clinic employs a sophisticated audience-based navigation system:

1. **Primary Navigation** - Main categories organized by audience and purpose:

   - Care at Mayo Clinic (patient services)
   - Health Library (consumer health information)
   - For Medical Professionals (healthcare provider resources)
   - Research & Education at Mayo Clinic (academic resources)
   - Giving to Mayo Clinic (philanthropic opportunities)

2. **Secondary Navigation** - Within "Care at Mayo Clinic" section:
   - Patient-Centered Care
   - About Mayo Clinic
   - Request Appointment
   - Find a Doctor
   - Locations
   - Clinical Trials
   - Connect to Support Groups
   - Patient & Visitor Guide
   - Billing & Insurance
   - Departments & Centers
   - International Services
   - Contact Us

This approach allows different user types to quickly find relevant information based on their specific needs and relationship to Mayo Clinic.

## URL Structure

Mayo Clinic employs a logical, hierarchical URL structure:

- Main domain: mayoclinic.org
- Section paths: mayoclinic.org/[section-name]
  - Example: mayoclinic.org/departments-centers
- Subsection paths: mayoclinic.org/[section-name]/[subsection]
  - Example: mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiology

Disease and condition pages follow a consistent pattern:

- mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/[condition-name]/symptoms-causes/syc-[id]
- mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/[condition-name]/diagnosis-treatment/drc-[id]

This structure creates clear content relationships, supports SEO, and provides a consistent user experience.
