- **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: Security standards for organizations that handle credit card information.

## UI/UX Design Best Practices

### User-Centered Design Principles

#### Research and Understanding Users

- **Conduct comprehensive user research** before beginning design, including interviews, surveys, and observational studies.
- **Create detailed user personas** based on research to guide design decisions.
- **Map user journeys** to understand how users interact with your product across different touchpoints.
- **Identify user pain points** and design specifically to address them.
- **Continuously validate designs** with real users through usability testing and feedback sessions.

#### Information Architecture

- **Organize content hierarchically** based on importance and user needs.
- **Implement intuitive navigation systems** that reflect users' mental models.
- **Use card sorting and tree testing** to validate information architecture.
- **Create clear wayfinding elements** to help users understand their location within the site.
- **Design for progressive disclosure** to prevent information overload.

#### Interaction Design

- **Follow established interaction patterns** that users already understand.
- **Provide clear feedback** for all user actions.
- **Design for error prevention** rather than just error handling.
