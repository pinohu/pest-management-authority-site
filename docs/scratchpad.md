## Lessons Learned
- To be updated as implementation progresses.
- [2024-06-09] Comprehensive planning across all enhancement areas ensures alignment with the architecture blueprint and prevents duplicated effort.
- [2024-06-09] Maintaining modular, testable task breakdowns accelerates parallel progress and simplifies verification.
- **[2025-01-28] Missing wp_enqueue_style() for main stylesheet was the primary cause of unstyled content - always verify style loading first when troubleshooting theme display issues.**
- **[2025-01-28] Modern WordPress themes require proper theme setup functions including add_theme_support(), navigation menus, and proper script/style enqueueing for full functionality.**
- **[2025-01-28] CSS gradients, shadows, and subtle animations significantly enhance visual appeal and user engagement without compromising performance.**
- [2024-06-09] Modular integration of all Directorist plugins/add-ons in inc/integrations/ ensures maintainability, extensibility, and testability. Avoid redundant logic in functions.php or elsewhere.
- [2024-06-09] Full niche-agnostic refactor: All demo content, directory types, and templates must be generic and easily customizable for any industry. This maximizes reusability, extensibility, and marketability of the theme.
