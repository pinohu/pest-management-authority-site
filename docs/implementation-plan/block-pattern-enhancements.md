# Block Pattern Enhancements Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Authority Blueprint theme leverages block patterns for rapid, consistent content creation. The architecture blueprint calls for a wide range of content types (FAQ, comparison, glossary, resource list, case study, etc.) that are not yet fully represented in the current block patterns directory.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Ensuring new patterns are accessible, responsive, and SEO-friendly
- Aligning pattern structure with content hub, cluster, and conversion page needs
- Supporting easy customization and extensibility

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [ ] Audit existing block patterns and identify gaps
- [ ] Define requirements and wireframes for each new pattern (FAQ, comparison, glossary, resource list, case study, etc.)
- [ ] Implement each pattern as a PHP file in block-patterns/
- [ ] Add pattern registration to functions.php
- [ ] Test in block editor and on front end for accessibility, responsiveness, and SEO
- [ ] Document usage in README
