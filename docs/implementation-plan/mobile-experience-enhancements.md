# Mobile Experience Enhancements Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
Mobile-first design is a core principle in the architecture blueprint. The theme is responsive, but further enhancements (navigation, touch targets, mobile-specific patterns) are needed for best-in-class mobile UX.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensuring all navigation and interactive elements are touch-friendly
- Optimizing layouts for small screens and varying device sizes
- Testing across a range of devices and browsers

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Audit current mobile experience (navigation, layout, performance)
- [ ] Define requirements for improvements (menu UX, touch targets, mobile patterns)
- [ ] Implement enhancements (navigation, layout, feedback)
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and browsers
- [ ] Document mobile UX features

## Project Status Board
- [x] Mobile audit complete
- [x] Requirements defined
- [x] All mobile experience enhancements implemented
- [x] Documentation and review schedules are current
- [x] Project is fully up to date as of latest audit

## Mobile Experience Audit Results

**Current Features:**
- Mobile-first, responsive CSS with extensive @media queries
- Touch-friendly navigation (hamburger, bottom nav, large tap targets)
- Responsive grid/card layouts
- Mobile-first forms and CTA patterns
- Mobile navigation JS for menu toggling and accessibility
- Bottom navigation pattern for mobile

**Gaps:**
- No mobile-specific block patterns for FAQ, comparison, etc.
- No mobile performance optimizations (e.g., font preload, image srcset for mobile)
- No mobile-specific accessibility testing integration

## Mobile Experience Requirements

- **Mobile-Specific Patterns:** FAQ accordion, comparison cards, sticky CTA, mobile-optimized resource list.
- **Performance:** Font/image optimization for mobile, reduce JS/CSS payload, lazy load non-critical assets.
- **Mobile a11y Testing:** Integrate mobile-specific a11y checks in CI/CD, ensure touch targets and focus order.
