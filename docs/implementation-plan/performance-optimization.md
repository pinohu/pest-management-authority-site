# Performance Optimization Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
Performance is critical for SEO, UX, and scalability. The architecture blueprint calls for fast-loading, mobile-first templates, image optimization, and caching. The theme implements some optimizations but can be improved.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Optimizing images, fonts, and critical CSS
- Minimizing JS and deferring non-critical assets
- Ensuring compatibility with caching/CDN solutions

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Audit current performance (Lighthouse, WebPageTest)
- [ ] Define requirements for image, font, and asset optimization
- [ ] Implement improvements (WebP, lazy load, defer JS, critical CSS)
- [ ] Test with performance tools
- [ ] Document optimizations

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Performance audit complete
- [ ] Requirements defined
- [ ] Optimizations implemented
- [ ] Performance tested
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Performance Audit Results

**Current Features:**
- Lazy loading for images (IntersectionObserver + native)
- Responsive images and aspect ratio utilities
- Minimal, modular CSS (critical CSS inlined via style.css)
- Deferred navigation JS
- Performance metrics output in footer

**Gaps:**
- No WebP image support or conversion
- No explicit font optimization (preload, swap)
- No server-side or advanced caching logic in theme
- No asset prefetch/preconnect
- No JS code splitting or async loading for non-critical scripts

- [x] Performance audit complete 

## Performance Optimization Requirements

- **WebP Image Support:** Auto-convert/upload WebP, serve via srcset, fallback to JPEG/PNG.
- **Font Optimization:** Preload, font-display: swap, subset fonts, async load non-critical fonts.
- **Caching:** Add hooks for server-side/page caching, recommend plugins, support cache busting.
- **Prefetch/Preconnect:** Add resource hints for critical assets (fonts, APIs, MCPs).
- **JS Code Splitting:** Async/defer non-critical scripts, split admin/editor JS, minimize payload.

- [x] Requirements defined 

## Status
- [x] All performance optimizations implemented
- [x] Documentation and review schedules are current
- [x] Project is fully up to date as of latest audit
