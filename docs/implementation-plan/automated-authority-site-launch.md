# Automated Authority Site Launch Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
Launching a fully-architected authority website for any niche should be as simple as providing a topic. This system will automate WordPress provisioning, theme/plugin setup, content and navigation generation, best practice enforcement (SEO, accessibility, performance), and MCP integrationâ€”delivering a live, production-ready site with minimal manual intervention.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Orchestrating WordPress provisioning (Docker, WP-CLI, REST API)
- Generating high-quality, niche-specific content and taxonomy via MCPs/AI
- Ensuring all best practices (SEO, accessibility, performance) are applied
- Integrating and coordinating multiple MCPs (content, alt text, moderation, monitoring)
- Handling errors, retries, and manual overrides
- Extensibility for future enhancements and customizations

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Define input format and user interface (CLI, web, API)
- [ ] Implement WordPress provisioning (Docker, WP-CLI, or multisite)
- [ ] Automate theme and plugin activation
- [ ] Integrate MCPs for taxonomy, navigation, and content generation
- [ ] Auto-generate all required page types and navigation
- [ ] Apply SEO, accessibility, and performance best practices
- [ ] Integrate monitoring and reporting (Pulsetic, Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Test end-to-end with sample niches
- [ ] Document process and provide extensibility hooks

## Project Status Board
- [x] Input handling defined
- [x] Provisioning implemented
- [x] Theme/plugins automated
- [x] MCP content/copy integration (pillar & cluster)
- [x] Navigation/taxonomy automation
- [x] Best practices enforcement
- [x] FAQ, homepage, and further MCP integration
- [x] Monitoring/reporting
- [x] End-to-end test
- [x] Documentation

## Lessons Learned
- Use Docker Compose for reliable, repeatable provisioning.
- Validate input and environment before proceeding with automation steps.
- Use WP-CLI in Docker for reliable theme/plugin automation.
- Output debug info for each step to aid troubleshooting.
- Use NEURONWriter MCP for high-quality, niche-specific content generation.
- Validate API responses and handle errors gracefully.
- Use WP-CLI to reliably create and assign categories/tags.
- Automate taxonomy assignment for all generated content for robust navigation.
- Automate site title, tagline, permalinks, and plugin settings for consistency.
- Use WP-CLI for all site configuration to ensure repeatability.
- Use NEURONWriter MCP for FAQ and homepage content for rapid, relevant site launch.
- Integrate AltText.ai and other MCPs at the theme/plugin level for best results.
- Integrate monitoring (Pulsetic, Sentry) at the end of the automation for full site health coverage.
- Use pseudo-calls in dev; require API keys and DNS for production monitoring.
- To be updated as implementation progresses.

## End-to-End Test Checklist
- [x] Run script with a sample niche (e.g., "plant-based nutrition")
- [x] Verify WordPress is provisioned and accessible
- [x] Theme and plugins are activated
- [x] Pillar, cluster, FAQ, and homepage content is generated and published
- [x] Categories and tags are created and assigned
- [x] Best practices (SEO, permalinks, caching) are enforced
- [x] Monitoring pseudo-call is executed
- [x] Site is fully functional and ready for launch

## Documentation Outline
- Overview and prerequisites
- Usage instructions (script, input, environment)
- Extensibility (adding MCPs, custom content types)
- Troubleshooting and logs
- Production considerations (API keys, DNS, security)

## Status
- [x] All automation steps complete
- [x] Documentation and review schedules are current
- [x] Project is fully up to date as of latest audit
