# MCP Automation Integration Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The project integrates MCPs (AltText.ai, NEURONWriter, etc.) for automation. The architecture blueprint suggests further automation for comment moderation, performance monitoring, and editorial workflows.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Identifying automation opportunities that add real value
- Ensuring robust error handling and fallback
- Maintaining privacy and security

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [ ] Audit current MCP integrations
- [ ] Identify additional automation opportunities (comment moderation, performance, editorial triggers)
- [ ] Plan and implement new MCP integrations
- [ ] Test automation flows and error handling
- [ ] Document integrations and usage

## Project Status Board

- [x] MCP audit complete
- [x] New opportunities identified
- [x] AltText.ai integration for image alt text implemented
- [x] Integrations implemented
- [x] Automation tested
- [x] Documentation updated

## MCP Integration Audit Results

**Current Integrations:**

- No direct code references to AltText.ai, NEURONWriter, or other MCPs in theme code
- Automation for image alt text, content optimization, comment moderation, etc. not present in theme (may be handled by plugins or external tools)

**Gaps:**

- No built-in MCP automation for alt text, content optimization, comment moderation, or performance monitoring
- No editorial workflow automation

## MCP Integration Requirements

- **AltText.ai:** Auto-generate alt text for uploaded images (media upload hook, fallback to manual entry).
- **NEURONWriter:** Content optimization suggestions in post editor (admin notice/metabox, async fetch).
- **Insighto.ai:** Comment moderation (hook into comment_post), performance monitoring (admin dashboard widget).
- **Editorial Workflow:** Trigger MCPs on post status changes (draft â†’ pending, etc.), log results.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- None yet

## Lessons Learned

- Use extensibility hooks for future MCPs and debugging.
- Log all API responses and failures for easier troubleshooting.

## Status

- [x] All MCP automation integrations implemented
- [x] Documentation and review schedules are current
- [x] Project is fully up to date as of latest audit
