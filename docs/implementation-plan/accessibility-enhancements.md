# Accessibility Enhancements Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

Accessibility is a core requirement in the architecture blueprint. The theme includes some accessibility features, but a full audit and further enhancements (ARIA, focus management, accessible forms, etc.) are needed.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Ensuring WCAG compliance across all templates and patterns
- Automating alt text and ARIA where possible
- Testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [ ] Audit current accessibility features
- [ ] Define requirements for ARIA, focus, forms, alt text
- [ ] Implement enhancements (ARIA, focus, forms, automation)
- [ ] Test with a11y tools and screen readers
- [ ] Document accessibility features

## Project Status Board

- [x] Accessibility audit complete
- [x] Requirements defined
- [ ] Enhancements implemented
- [ ] Accessibility tested
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Accessibility Audit Results

**Current Features:**

- ARIA roles and labels on navigation, regions, and announcements
- Skip link to main content (with focus management JS)
- Visually hidden (sr-only) and screen-reader-text utilities
- Accessible forms (labels, required fields, error states)
- ARIA live region for announcements
- Focus styles and high-contrast support
- Accessible navigation (keyboard, touch targets)
- Accessibility statement in /legal

**Gaps:**

- No automated alt text (MCP integration missing)
- No explicit error summary for forms
- No accessible FAQ/accordion pattern
- No automated accessibility testing integration

## Accessibility Requirements

- **Automated Alt Text:** Integrate AltText.ai for all images, fallback to manual entry.
- **Error Summary for Forms:** Display error summary at top of forms, link to invalid fields, ARIA live region.
- **Accessible FAQ/Accordion:** ARIA-compliant, keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly, semantic headings.
- **Automated a11y Testing:** Integrate a11y MCP or axe-core for CI/CD and admin dashboard, report issues.
